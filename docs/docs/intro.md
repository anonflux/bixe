# Introduction

## What is BiXE?

BiXE is a fast and lightweight, framework agnostic, redux-like state management solution.

Write your business logic once. Reuse it anywhere/everywhere. Diagram it automagic.

BiXE offers these benefits:
1. Stores can be scoped/grouped easily, and actions can target a specific group/scope or all
2. Testing is as easy as mocking 2 arguments and testing individual functions
3. No side effects, just a clean call site
4. Dispatched actions and store interactions may be diagrammed and understood at a glance
5. Asynchrony is a first-class concept; no need to jump through hoops or get creative
