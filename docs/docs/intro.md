# Introduction

## What is BiXE?

BiXE is a fast and lightweight, framework agnostic, redux-like state management solution.

It allows you to write your business logic once, and reuse it in any JavaScript or TypeScript application, regardless of whether it is a front-end application or a back-end application. It was written and designed by developers for developers; DX, performance, flexibility and visibility are the most important things.

BiXE eliminates cruft, and alleviates common pain points associated with other well-known redux-like solutions.

Some benefits:
1. Stores can be scoped/grouped easily, and actions can target a specific group/scope or all
2. Testing is as easy as mocking 2 arguments and testing individual functions
3. No side effects, just a clean call site
4. Dispatched actions and store interactions may be diagrammed and understood at a glance
5. Asynchrony is a first-class concept; no need to jump through hoops or get creative
